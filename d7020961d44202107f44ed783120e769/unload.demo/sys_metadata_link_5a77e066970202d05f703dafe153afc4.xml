        <response>**Last 10 Years of Weather History in India**

**Overall Pattern:**

* The last 10 years have been characterized by a mixed pattern of weather conditions, with some regions experiencing normal rainfall, others experiencing drought, and some experiencing extreme weather events.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Record Rainfall:** India has received above-average rainfall in several parts of the country, particularly in the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. This has led to a significant reduction in drought-affected areas and increased agricultural productivity.
* **Extreme Heat:** Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, particularly in the western and central regions. The state of Rajasthan has faced severe heat waves, with record temperatures and deaths.
* **Drought:** Parts of the country, particularly in the northwest and north-central regions, have experienced severe droughts, resulting in water shortages and crop failures.
* **Cyclone Activity:** The Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea have witnessed an increase in cyclone activity in recent years, bringing heavy rainfall and storm surges to different parts of the country.
* **La Ni�a-Southern Oscillation:** The Indian Ocean has experienced a shift in weather patterns, with an increase in La Ni�a events. This has resulted in wetter-than-average conditions in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, bringing more rainfall to India.

**Specific Weather Events:**

* **2019-2020:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A severe drought affected several parts of the country, particularly in the central and northern regions.
* **2019:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A severe heat wave in the western and central regions caused widespread crop failures and water shortages.
* **2022:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; A devastating cyclone named Hudhud made landfall in the southern state of Gujarat, causing severe damage and loss of life.

**Climate Change Impacts:**

* India is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.
* Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and increasing extreme weather events are posing significant challenges to agriculture, water resources, and public health.
* Climate change is also expected to exacerbate droughts, floods, and other environmental issues in the country.

**Additional Points:**

* India's weather patterns are also influenced by seasonal variations, with the monsoon season playing a crucial role in determining the availability of water.
* The country is experiencing a shift towards a more humid climate, with increased rainfall in some regions and droughts in others.
* The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provides regular weather forecasts and climate projections for the country.</response>
